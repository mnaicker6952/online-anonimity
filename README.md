The risk to such software is that it could be connected to the trafficking of harmful substances or obscene pictures, by enable them to be hidden on the web. For example dangers criminals can use such a site to post online pictures of a censored description and to sell and buy weapons. It’s also a way for such organisations to communicate and discuss their plans and details privately and unwatched.  It can be used by governments to hid information of important events or things countries don’t want people to see.
However a benefit for this network is that if the network is that if you wish not to be monitored on want you are doing. Or if you are part of a ‘spy’ group you can use the network to hid you self on your matter’s.
